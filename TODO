- Migrate to containers
-- installed docker
X Set up space for experimenting with Rust/webasm
-- new branch created for this
-- use containers to run each one
-- use web server routing to access each docker?
--- likely by ProxyPass
--- set up routing container at /playground/ (for now, eventually make it root and serve blog by default)
--- docker network/compose based at experiements, serve up each container as a page
--- add proxypass/proxyreversepass rules to apache
--- add rewrite rules to properly serve site assets (js/css (footer/header?))
--- This works!!
-- Use main site to load content using javascript into content area
-- Use Docker compose to bring up experiments root and containers for each experiment
--- This works!! See /home/www/experiments

- Add more content
-- Feed in from some source that can be edited locally, synced on cloud, published here
- Set up secondary site (port redirect) to work on site while main one stays as-is
