This is my inaugural post on my new whatever this is, so like any good developer, it's a `Hello World` post.

There's not much to say just yet, it will take time to get used to figuring out what to write in this thing. I think I'll be using it primarily to show progress on some projects I've been working on, and that I will be working on. I have one I did last year that I'll probably put up, and I have one I shelved for the summer that I'll be picking up again when the weather becomes less hospitable. I also have a large web-based project I've been turning over in my head for years now that I want to eventually build out. We'll see.
